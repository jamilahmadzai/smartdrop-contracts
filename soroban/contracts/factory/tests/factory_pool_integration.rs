//! Workspace-level integration suite for issue #87.
//!
//! Per-crate unit tests (`factory/src/test.rs`, `farming-pool/src/test.rs`) each
//! register their own contract directly via `env.register(..)` and exercise it
//! in isolation. Neither suite proves that a farming-pool instance *born from
//! `Factory::create_pool`* — i.e. deployed from real, compiled farming-pool
//! WASM via `env.deployer().deploy_v2`, at the address the factory computed
//! and recorded — actually behaves like a farming pool once driven through a
//! `FarmingPoolClient`. That cross-contract deployment boundary (factory
//! deploys real bytecode, caller then talks to the deployed instance through
//! the *other* crate's generated client) is exactly what unit tests using
//! `env.register(FarmingPool, ())` cannot cover, because they never go through
//! `deploy_v2` at all. This file closes that gap. See issue #87.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in `factory/tests/`
//!
//! `factory/Cargo.toml` already carries `farming-pool` as a path
//! dev-dependency, and `cargo test --workspace` (the exact command CI's
//! "Run tests" step runs) automatically discovers and runs every file under
//! `factory/tests/` as its own integration-test binary. That makes this the
//! lowest-friction home: no new workspace member, no `[workspace.members]`
//! edit, and it is exercised by CI with zero additional wiring.
//!
//! ## Real WASM, not a native call
//!
//! Because this file is an external integration test (not `mod test;` inside
//! the crate), it only sees `factory`'s and `farming-pool`'s *public* API —
//! same as any real caller would. To deploy a genuine farming-pool instance
//! the way `Factory::create_pool` does in production, the test needs actual
//! compiled farming-pool WASM bytes to hand to
//! `env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(..)`, exactly as
//! `factory/src/test.rs` does today with its small synthetic `MOCK_POOL_WASM`
//! blob — except here we want the *real* contract, not a stand-in, so the
//! lifecycle tests below actually exercise farming-pool's real logic.
//!
//! `tests/fixtures/farming_pool.wasm` is a checked-in build of the
//! farming-pool crate for the `wasm32v1-none` target (the target this
//! workspace's CI and `#[81]`'s remediation both settled on, since
//! soroban-sdk 25.3.1 rejects `wasm32-unknown-unknown` on modern Rust). It is
//! loaded via `include_bytes!` below, so `cargo test --workspace` needs no
//! prerequisite build step, no build.rs, and no manual instructions on a
//! fresh clone — the bytes are just part of the checked-in source tree.
//!
//! Trade-off: this fixture can go stale if farming-pool's source changes
//! without regenerating it. That risk is bounded — an interface drift (e.g. a
//! renamed or re-signatured method) will make the lifecycle tests below fail
//! loudly (link/invoke errors), not pass silently — and it avoids a much
//! riskier alternative: a `build.rs` that shells out to a nested `cargo build`
//! for every build of the `factory` package (including its production release
//! WASM build), which would slow down and complicate a build step that has
//! nothing to do with testing. Regenerate the fixture after any farming-pool
//! change with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cd soroban
//! cargo build -p farming-pool --target wasm32v1-none --release
//! cp target/wasm32v1-none/release/farming_pool.wasm \
//!    contracts/factory/tests/fixtures/farming_pool.wasm
//! ```
