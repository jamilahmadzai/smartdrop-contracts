# SmartDrop Contracts - Event Schema Registry

This document defines the event schemas actually emitted by the SmartDrop contracts (`Factory`, `FarmingPool`, and `VestingWallet`), as of the current `soroban/contracts` source. Off-chain indexers rely on these definitions; any modification to topics or payload shapes constitutes a client-breaking change.

Topic tuples below are written in emission order, exactly as passed to `env.events().publish((topic0, topic1), data)`. Payload tables list fields in tuple order (unnamed events publish a bare value, not a struct).

* **Payload:** `()` — no data.

### `emrg_exit`
Emitted by `emergency_withdraw` (user-authorized, requires the pool to be paused).
